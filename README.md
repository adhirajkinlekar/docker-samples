# Docker Samples Repository  

Welcome to the **Docker Samples Repository**! 🚀  

This repository contains a collection of Docker configurations for various applications and services. The goal is to provide ready-to-use Docker Compose files and Dockerfiles to simplify the setup and deployment of different technologies.  

## 📌 What's Inside?  

This repository will include:  
- **Database Containers** (e.g., relational and NoSQL databases)  
- **Storage Solutions**  
- **Development and Testing Environments**  
- **Microservices and APIs**  
- **Monitoring and Logging Tools**  
- **Message Brokers**  
- **Other Essential DevOps Tools**  

## 📖 How to Use?  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```  

2. **Navigate to the Desired Service**  
   Each service has its own directory with a `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile`.  

3. **Start the Service**  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```  

4. **Stop and Remove Containers**  
   ```bash
