Here's a sample `README.md` you can use for your Docker Swarm setup with Traefik:

---

# 🐳 Docker Swarm Microservices with Traefik

This repository demonstrates how to deploy microservices (`admin-service` and `auth-service`) using **Docker Swarm** and **Traefik** as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

---

## 🚀 Why Docker Swarm?

Docker Swarm provides native clustering and orchestration for Docker containers. Key advantages:

- Simple CLI and Compose-based deployment
- Built-in **service discovery** and **load balancing**
- Scalable with **replica management**
- Secure communication between nodes using **overlay networks**

---

## 🌐 Why Traefik?

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is a modern, cloud-native reverse proxy and load balancer designed for microservices. It supports dynamic service discovery, automatic routing, TLS, and more.

- Automatically routes based on **container labels**
- Works natively with **Docker Swarm**
- Lightweight and production-ready
- Easy integration with **Let’s Encrypt** for HTTPS

## 📁 Shared Compose File — But Different

Although we use `docker-compose.yml`, this setup is **not** run with `docker-compose up`.

Instead, we use `docker stack deploy`, which has Swarm-specific behavior:

| Feature                  | `docker-compose`                | `docker stack deploy`                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Mode                     | Local development                | Production or multi-node orchestration  |
| Networks                 | Bridge by default                | Requires **overlay** networks            |
| Secrets / Configs        | Limited                          | Fully supported                          |
| Labels                   | Applied per container            | Applied per **service**                  |

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

### 1. ✅ Prerequisites

- Docker (with Swarm enabled)
- Local Traefik setup via this repo
- Update `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 admin.myswarmapp.com auth.myswarmapp.com
```

---

### 2. 🧠 Create the Overlay Network (One-time)

```bash
docker network create --driver=overlay backend
```

---

### 3. 🚀 Deploy the Stack

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml mystack
```

This will:

- Start Traefik
- Start the `admin-service` and `auth-service`
- Register them with Traefik automatically

---

### 4. 🧪 Access the Services

Open your browser:

- [`http://admin.myswarmapp.com`](http://admin.myswarmapp.com)
- [`http://auth.myswarmapp.com`](http://auth.myswarmapp.com)
- [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) → Traefik Dashboard

---

### 5. 🛑 Stop and Clean Up

To take down the stack:

```bash
docker stack rm mystack
```

Optionally remove the overlay network (if not used elsewhere):

```bash
docker network rm backend
```

---

## 🔐 Bonus: Add HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt

You can enable HTTPS by:

- Uncommenting the `websecure` entrypoint and resolver configs in `docker-compose.yml`
- Mounting a volume for certificate storage
- Exposing port `443` in the Traefik service

----

## 🧩 Future Ideas

- Add persistent secrets (e.g. DB passwords)
- Use external config files for dynamic routing
- Deploy to remote nodes or cloud (via docker-machine or VPS)
